# Android Studio Runtime Permission Example

This example project demonstrates the implementation of runtime permissions in an Android application using Android Studio. The project focuses on handling the runtime permission for accessing external storage.

## Overview

The main purpose of this Android application is to showcase how to request and handle runtime permissions, specifically for reading external storage. The user is prompted to grant the necessary permission for the app to function correctly. Additionally, the project includes handling scenarios where the user denies the permission and how to guide them to the app settings to grant the required permission.

## Implementation

The key components of the project include:

- **MainActivity.java**: The main activity of the application containing the logic for requesting and handling runtime permissions.

- **activity_main.xml**: The layout file defining the UI components, including a button that triggers the permission request.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atiquz/AndroidStudioPermission.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

4. Click the "Request Permission" button to initiate the runtime permission request process.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to either grant or deny the required storage permission.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the app's functionality and the permission request process.

## Note
